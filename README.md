# Salary-Prediction-Using-Regression

üìä Salary Prediction using Multivariate Linear Regression
This project demonstrates how to predict employee salaries using multiple variables such as:

Years of Experience

Education Level

Performance Rating

Location

The model is built using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression with the statsmodels Python package.

üìÅ Dataset
A synthetic dataset of 250 employees was generated with the following columns:

Column	Description
Name	Randomly generated full names
Age	Age (22‚Äì60 years)
YearsExperience	Estimated based on age
EducationLevel	High School, Associate, Bachelor, Master, PhD
PerformanceRating	Poor, Average, Good, Excellent
Location	One of five U.S. cities
Salary	Calculated based on all above factors

üß† Model Details
A multivariate regression model was used to understand how each factor impacts salary.

R-squared: 0.982
‚û° This means 98.2% of the salary variation is explained by the model ‚Äî indicating high accuracy.

üîç Key Findings
Feature	Effect on Salary
YearsExperience	+$2,165 per year
EducationLevel	Higher education = higher salary:
‚Ä¢ Bachelor: +$13.5K
‚Ä¢ Master: +$27K
‚Ä¢ PhD: +$40K
‚Ä¢ High School: -$5.7K (compared to Associate)
PerformanceRating	‚Ä¢ Good: +$4.7K
‚Ä¢ Excellent: +$7.3K
‚Ä¢ Poor: -$2.4K (compared to Average)
Location	Salaries vary by city:
‚Ä¢ New York: +$8.7K
‚Ä¢ LA: +$5.8K
‚Ä¢ Houston: -$4.4K
‚Ä¢ Phoenix: -$6.9K (compared to Chicago)
